Gerald is a learning project to get me back up and running with coding, since I
have not programmed anything worthwhile in more than 10 years.
Gerald's name was suggested by Akerlie.

Gerald will:


1- Connect to twitch with a secondary account
2- sit in channel(s) and parse what people say.
3- It will count emotes used per user.
4- It will keep count of the favourite emote per user
5- It will keep count of the top 10 emotes used in the channel.


To do this, the following is needed to learn:


1- Find out how to connet to twitch's irc (already done)
2- Find out how to detect emotes (already done)
3- Relearn how to deal with databases (totally forgot how), learn an orm (most
probably gorm)
4- Learn how to structure the go project, I have seen a standard floating
around, but unsure how to structure gorm models/functions yet.
5- start with sqlite for ease then use a proper db later.


Random points:

1- Dockerised!
2- Log output for log aggregation (stdout)
3- idiomatic 
4- Load balancing
5- Kubernetes? (yes overkill, but the point is to learn)


yeah enough... good start...


Questions? Remarks?

1 - I wonder if I should structure it as a MVC project?
2 - keep an eye on :  golang-migrate /
migrate
3 - I have no idea what I am doing...
4 - 


TODO:

1-Tmux is not configured on this pc! blasphemy!



DB Notes:
(probably should dust up my uml skills...)
1 - user N:N emote
2 - user N:N channel
3 - users have multiple roles in channel: broadcaster, mod, viewer(vip,normal)
4 - users have multiple types/roles globally(find out what):staff , ...
(I wonder if instead of string as type/role I should have a limited list of
existing roles, or just keep it open for future expandibility? who knows what
are the best practices...
